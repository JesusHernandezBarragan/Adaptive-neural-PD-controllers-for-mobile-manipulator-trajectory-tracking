Adaptive neural PD controllers for mobile manipulator trajectory tracking

The main scripts to run the proposed adaptive neural controllers are main_Single_ANN and main_Multilayer_ANN. 
The compared controllers are given in scripts main_CPID and main_PID.

The results from simulations are given in the folder named Comparison results. 
The results from real experiments are given in the folder named Experimental results. 
Please run the main.m scripts to obtain the results presented in graphs and tables. 

Note: The files were created with MATLAB R2017a. It is convenient to provide the Raw data in MAT format. 
MAT files contain variables and data necessary to run the simulation files.
